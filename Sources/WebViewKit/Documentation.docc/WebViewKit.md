# ``WebViewKit``

WebViewKit adds a ``WebView`` view to SwiftUI, that can be used to load local and online web pages.


## Overview

## Supported Platforms

WebViewKit supports **iOS 13** and **macOS 11**.


## Installation

WebViewKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/WebViewKit.git
```


## About this documentation

While the documentation can be built for both iOS and macOS, the online version is currently built for macOS. This means that it's macOS-specific and lacks iOS-specific types like `SafariWebView`.

To create an iOS-specific documentation, open the package in Xcode, select an iOS Simulator then generate documentation from the `Product` menu.

Any help in making the documentation multi-platform would be greatly appreciated.
