The `WebView` view can load any url and be fully configured to fit your needs. For more basic needs, you have a `SafariWebView` as well.



## Supported Platforms

WebViewKit supports `iOS 13` and `macOS 11`.



## Installation

WebViewKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```

```

You can also clone the repository and build the library locally.
