# ``WebViewKit``

WebViewKit adds a ``WebView`` view to SwiftUI, that can be used to load local and online web pages.


## Overview

## Supported Platforms

WebViewKit supports **iOS 13** and **macOS 11**.


## Installation

WebViewKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/WebViewKit.git
```


## About this documentation

While the documentation can be built for both iOS and macOS, the online documentation is currently built for macOS only. This means that it's macOS specific and lacks certain iOS-only types like `SafariWebView`.

To see the iOS-specific documentation, open the project in Xcode, select an iOS Simulator and generate documentation from the `Product` menu.

Any help in making the documentation multi-platform would be greatly appreciated.
